                        <p>Today, over half of the America’s jobs fall under the classification “middle-skill” - work requiring experience or credentials beyond a high-school education, but not a four-year degree.  While the prevalence of these jobs offers considerable economic opportunity, there remains a stark gap between the growing availability of these positions and the number of Americans qualified to fill them.  Moreover, with middle-skill jobs projected to account for 40% of all new job growth in the United States by 2017, this “skills gap” is poised to increase even further, barring corrective action from policymakers and labor stakeholders.
                            <br><br>
                            Our analysis explores the widening American skills gap through the lens of a key cohort of economic actors: states. Using data aggregated from a range of federal agencies/institutions (Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Center for Education Statistics), we have identified a set of state behaviors that are indicative of how well each state’s labor force has kept pace with the market demand for middle-skilled labor.  The nature of these attributes - including high spending per student for community college education, job training programs, and secondary-level vocational training - point to increased investment in workforce development and more comprehensive utilization of federal funding sources as potential policy levers that can be used to create and maintain a future-ready workforce.</p>
